I used this template for TODOs (TODO: add to doc: | TODO doc: ) whenever I have a note to add to the final documentation.
But some of these notes will not make it into the documentation since they are not important.
So I chose to leave them in my code instead of deleting them.
So keep an eye on green comments (or whatever color your editor uses)
