This is the Library Project.
It's a library management console application system. 




HOW TO USE:
	make sure to run the json-server before running the application:
	open terminal in the jsonServer folder and run the command: "npx json-server --watch db.json"
	
	once the server is running check the port (by default it's 3000), if it's not 3000 then go to the DatabaseService class and modify BASE_API_URL
	//TODO: save the address in an .ini file      
	
	And you are good to go.
