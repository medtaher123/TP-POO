# Object-Oriented Programming Assignments

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming Assignments repository! This repository houses a collection of programming assignments completed during coursework related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Overview

The repository includes the following projects and exercises:

- **E-Commerce Console Application (Exam Project):**
  - A console-based application simulating an e-commerce platform. It allows users to perform various actions such as managing products, user accounts, shopping carts, placing orders, and more.

- **Library Management System (Homework Project):**
  - A console-based application designed to manage library operations. Users can handle book inventory, user accounts, subscriptions, bookings, and returns.

- **Programming Exercises (Homework):**
  - Several smaller exercises covering fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.

### About the Repository

This repository, "TP-POO," is primarily dedicated to coursework for an Object-Oriented Programming course. The "Examen TP" represents the final exam project, while the other submissions, including exercises and the library project, serve as homework assignments.

Feel free to explore the projects and exercises within this repository. They showcase the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming principles and serve as learning material for OOP enthusiasts and programming learners.

For detailed instructions on running each project or exercise, please refer to the respective project's README file.
